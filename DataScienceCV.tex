I am pleased to present my application for a position of POSITION at COMPANY.

I am a Manchester based Data Scientist with a history in Front-End Development, Digital Marketing and Digital Art. I am now aspiring to further my skills as a Data Scientist. I spend my free time creating Digital Art, getting paid to do Digital Marketing and participating in Data Science competitions.

From my time as a web developer, I am used to getting my work into live environments. My work as a digital artist and Fron-End Developer bubbles up in my Data Science work with a craving for visualization.

I am a strong believer in AGILE methodologies, while appreciating that other methods have their place, and have used SCRUM and Kanban professionally. I hold a firm belief that User Experience and Data Science are the key to the future of success in the technology sector and am always keen to bring these aspects into my development when appropriate. I am confident in running Retrospectives, Stand-ups and reflective meetings as I believe these are vital for improving team happiness and love opportunities to apply these to data science teams.

I have organized events of many scale from small Digital Art meet-ups to much larger scale University events with over 500 attendees. I am always eager to take part in events such as MancJS and MacnML and bring any learnings back into the business where possible. I have given a handful of talks such as "CSS as a digital art form" and "How to Fake it until you make it, a Digital Marketing Case Study".

I see Data Science problems like crosswords in the back of a newspaper, I enjoy the fun puzzles they bring in my day-to-day life and occasionally participate in Kaggle competitions to assess my skills. I look forward to further utilizing my skills in R and python in a and am keen to learn continuous integration and continuous deployment and much more.

Thank you very much for your time and I am thankful for the opportunity of being considered for this position.

Hope to hear from you soon.

\section{Experience}
\cventry{2017--Current}{Data Scientist}{LateRooms.com}{Manchester}{}{Working on the Data Science Team has given me an opportunity to add an Agile way of work, and a more rigorous process in an environment that welcomes it.
\begin{itemize}
\item Hotel Rank Algorithm, a system which generates the rankings of hotels. I implemented multiprocessing to reduce the generation time. I will also be implementing new features, bringing the algorithm out of its aged state.
\item A Random Forest model which predicts a users percentage to book when they first hit the site.
\item Creating a middle-ware which allows the results of a data science model to affect the content displayed on the main website.
\item Occasional short term investigations such as "Does the sentiment of Hotel Descriptions correlate with Hotel Success?" and "How have our hotels changed over time?".
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2015--2017}{Foundation UI Developer}{LateRooms.com}{Manchester}{}{Front-End Developer mainly focusing on the daily additions to the website using HTML,CSS,JS along with some larger deliverables such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Co-brands generator, an npm package which allows the creation of a new co-brand from a handful of inputs, this allowed me to utilize Sass to quickly generate a re-styling of the entire website.
\item Geo-shapes dashboard, worked closely with the Data Science team to create a React dashboard which would allow them to quickly track the progress of their geo-shape experiments.
\item New platform, currently working on creating a new platform to run many brand off of simultaneously using React with styled components. This is an exciting new challenge for me and I am happy to be part of a large project from its conception.
