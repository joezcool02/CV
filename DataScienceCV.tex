I am pleased to present my application for a position of Junior Data Scientist at LateRooms.com.

I am a Manchester based Web Developer is studying Computer Science and Maths with Industrial Experience at the University of Manchester. I have been a Web Developer since my first year at University where I decided to start my own Web Development company and I am now aspiring to become a Data Scientist. I spend my free time creating Digital Art, getting paid to do Digital Marketing and participating in Data Science competitions.

I am a strong believer in AGILE methodologies, while appreciating that other methods have their place, and have used SCRUM and Kanban professionally. I hold a firm belief that User Experience and Data Science are the key to the future of success at LateRooms.com and am always keen to bring these aspects into my development when appropriate. I am confident in running Retrospectives, Stand-ups and reflective meetings as I believe these are vital for improving team happiness and love opportunities to apply these methods.

I have organized events of many scale from small Digital Art meet-ups to much larger scale University events with over 500 attendees. I am always eager to take part in events such as MancJS and MacnML and bring any learnings back into the business where possible. I have given a handful of talks such as "CSS as a digital art form" and "How to Fake it until you make it, a Digital Marketing Case Study".

I am always looking to learn new things and have taken it upon myself to work through the Machine Learning course on Udacity. I see Data Science problems like crosswords in the back of a newspaper, I enjoy the fun puzzles they bring in my day-to-day life and occasionally participate in Kaggle competitions to assess my skills. I look forward to further utilizing my skills in R and python in a professional environment and am keen to learn continuous integration and continuous deployment.

Thank you very much for your time and I am thankful for the opportunity of being considered for this position.

Hope to hear from you soon.
